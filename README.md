# MineSweeper

In this project; I tried to implement a grid system, which I then used to implement a minesweeper game.

There are two different files in this project. In the [first stage](https://github.com/CahidArda/MineSweeper/blob/master/MineSweeper.py) where I implemented the game itself without adding termination conditions. In the [second stage](https://github.com/CahidArda/MineSweeper/blob/master/MineSweeper2.py), I added to failing condition (clicking on a mine).
